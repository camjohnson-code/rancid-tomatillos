Rancid Tomatillos is a project aimed at building a web application that provides information about movies, including ratings, reviews, and other related data. This project utilizes [insert technologies or frameworks used, e.g., React, Node.js, etc.] to create a user-friendly interface for browsing movies and accessing relevant information.

## Features
- Browse a vast database of movies.
- View detailed information about each movie, including ratings, reviews, cast, and crew.
- Search functionality to find movies by genre or title quickly.
- User authentication and authorization for personalized experiences.
- The ability to give ratings to a movie you've seen

### Challenges

This was our first project built in React. With it came some notable challenges, including:
- The use of React Router to change paths
- Getting familiar with useState and useEffect to render and update components
- Introducing Cypress testing with intercepts to avoid pinging API
- Understanding styling with css hierarchy and applying classNames for applying custom styling 

### Installation
Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:camjohnson-code/rancid-tomatillos.git`

### Navigate to the project directory:

`cd rancid-tomatillos`

### Install dependencies:

`npm install`

### Usage
Start the development server:

`npm start`

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

#### Future Improvements

In the future, we'd like to improve the site by adding these features: 
- Page responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Enable cookies so the user stays logged in after page refresh
- Add page transition animations between the main page and movie info
- Add a "load more" button in the All Movies section and only display a few rows of movies on page load
- Deploy this app to a live page
